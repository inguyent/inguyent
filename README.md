Hi, I’m Isabelle Nguyen (@inguyent).
I am a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego.
I am obtaining a degree in Chemical Engineering with a specialization in Process Controls and Dynamics.
My goal over the next year is to learn more about the various applications of chemical engineering to find more interests and potential long-term career pathways. 
Currently, my main interest has been in controls and how they can be used to automate reactors and maintain system conditions.
I can be reached via the following email: i.nguyent7@gmail.com
