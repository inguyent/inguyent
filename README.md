Hi, I’m Isabelle Nguyen (@inguyent).
I’m interested in learning more about the applications of chemical engineering in biotechnology and aeronautics.
My goal over the next year is to learn more about the various applications of chemical engineering to find more interests and potential long-term career pathways. 
I’m currently learning how to code in Python and attending summer classes to broaden my knowledge of controls.
I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that pertain to aeronautics, biotechnology, or robotics.
I can be reached via the following email: i.nguyent7@gmail.com
